It is part of the week-long commemoration and celebration of Lobo Foundation Anniversary that usually ends on the 29th day of September – the feast day of St. Michael the Archangel. Various activities such as Alay-Lakad, Kasalang Bayan, Entertainment Night, Job Fair, Agri-Trade Fair, Search for Miss Lobo Pageant, Street Dancing Competition, Float Parade, Search for Anihan Festival Queen, Cultural Presentation and Fluvial Procession are being celebrated. These activities or events are being participated in by LGU, students from both private and public secondary schools, senior high school, elementary school pupils of the district, and other private individuals whose active involvement is so excellent. The contingent’s' outfits were made from crude materials from items which Lobo is known for. The innovative outfits were decorated and made from buli, corn, coconut husk, anahaw leaf, and shells. A large portion of the outfits were likely designed with atis-inspired props. The participants could make use of popular music to dance to. Each school’s best dancers take time and effort to lead other pupils to dance using modern choreography. Hours would be spent perfecting the dance and stunts routine. Props too add color and excitement to their presentations and to rival competitors. The plethora of sights and sounds of the Anihan Festival draws crowds of thousands to the town plaza to watch the event. Adding color to the festivity are the parade of creatively designed floats, with muses of competing tribes, and the Search for Anihan Festival Queen.	2001-09-26 16:00:00	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/441806b8-61ff-4215-bbec-02d971fd0ed9,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/442eed9d-87b5-4034-8fde-742a9761b080,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/b6aa1ff6-55ba-4373-9678-7741e769e20d,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/edbe2766-75e9-474b-b2c4-33a7a2b15746,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/4fc746c3-7b66-4c28-82a3-2033d4554e17}	Lobo	Batangas	Unknown Barangay

Miguel Malvar Shrine is located in Poblacion 1, City of Sto. Tomas, in the province of Batangas, Philippines. The shrine is dedicated to General Miguel Malvar, one of the prominent figures in Philippine history and the last Filipino general to surrender to American forces during the Philippine-American War. Here's a brief history of Gen. Miguel Malvar and the shrine: General Miguel Malvar was born on September 27, 1865, in Santo Tomas, Batangas. He played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule and continued his fight for independence during the Philippine-American War that followed.\nAfter the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo in 1901, Malvar assumed leadership of the Filipino forces. He led a resistance movement against the American occupation and fought several battles in Batangas and nearby provinces. Despite facing significant challenges and outnumbered by American forces, Malvar continued his resistance for several months.\nIn April 1902, recognizing the difficulties of his situation and the plight of his soldiers, Malvar decided to surrender to the Americans. His surrender effectively marked the end of major organized resistance against American rule in the Philippines. Malvar subsequently pursued a career in politics and served as a senator in the Philippine legislature.\nThe Gen. Miguel Malvar Shrine in the City of Sto. Tomas stands as a tribute to General Miguel Malvar's leadership and contributions to the Philippine struggle for independence. The shrine serves as a historical and educational site where visitors can learn about Malvar's life, his role in the revolution, and the broader context of the Philippine-American War. The shrine may feature artifacts, exhibits, and information about Malvar's life, military achievements, and his significance in Philippine history. 	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/e8b5504e-9510-49f3-971b-9e549f40cf8b,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/ed4369b1-cc14-4122-b6f8-6be93980a717,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/9aefb341-d1a5-4d4f-9902-01926be204a8,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/5a638029-0d2a-4b35-9834-d2a6342595b2}	{none}	Batangas	Sto.

This airfield is about 45 nautical miles south-south-east of Manila in the province of Batangas (GEOREF: VGBP080575), covering an area of 272 hectares of land and the weather is generally cool throughout the year. The Japanese Imperial Army started construction of a base in 1942, utilizing some American POWs and Filipino forced labor. Due to its strategic location, the occupation army later converted the place into a fighter base for the Japanese Imperial Air Force. In early 1945, after Batangas was liberated, the US army occupied the base in Lipa, Batangas. The famed 11th Airborne Division, the US Army used this base as a staging point for paratroop assaults in the liberation of Cavite and Corregidor. At the same time the “Airfield in Lipa” or simply Lipa Airfield was used for aircraft recovery operations.\n-On September 1st of the same year, the Philippine Army Air Corps established the First Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS) in this base. Captain Roberto Lim, the base first Commander, chose this site because of its good water supply and cool climate. The airfield was officially designated as Lipa Army Air Base. Later, there was a talk that surfaced among the personnel of the base to rename it Lawas Army Base after MSg Gregorio Lawas, an airman who died in a vehicular accident. MSg Lawas was one of their top mechanics and he was also the first airman sent to Randolf, US for Air Mechanics Course. However this proposal was never pushed through.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/59056bc7-1e38-4a8e-a708-624098c9ad88,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/b240c1c2-2847-4d93-88c6-ed55eed40ca2,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/c7dbdf60-06f0-4393-a841-c24c567b5e04,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/8b544837-f908-4acf-89a4-c1cb109baaf6,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/1b8032b7-3d81-4afb-9c12-3924faabcbc7}	{none}	Batangas	Lipa City	Brgy.

In 1891, Spanish engineer Guillermo Brockman, who also designed the lighthouses at Capul Island and San Bernardino Island, created a design for a lighthouse in Punta Malabrigo which consisted of a Victorian architecture-inspired cylindrical brick tower with a metal staircase and double balcony, lighthouse keeper's quarters, and machine room. The company of Chinese contractor Jose Garcia constructed the lighthouse out of brick and lime cement and completed it in 1896, with the lighthouse being lit for the first time on October 1, 1896.

Founded in 1584, its original location was at the north shore of Taal Lake, then still called Bonbon. Its first church and convent were built that same year using wood and other light materials that were native to the area. The rudimentary church was replaced by a stone structure by 1732 that was sadly short-lived. In 1754, the debris from the Taal Volcano’s eruption blocked the lake’s flow, causing water levels to rise. The damage wrought by the strong aftershocks, ashfall, and the rising flood waters rendered many of the lake shore towns inhabitable, including Tanauan.\n-Tanuan was relocated to its permanent site and St. John the Evangelist Parish Church soon rose thereafter. The present structure, which was built from 1881-98 by Fr. Jose Diaz, sustained damage during World War II. It was rebuilt in 1948 by Monsignor Marino and Arch. Jose L. Zaragoza in keeping with its original Romanesque style.  The convent, which was built in 1872 and also destroyed in 1944, was rebuilt together with the cathedral. The church has a beautiful yet simple exterior that combines Romanesque and High Renaissance influences. The entryway of the relatively sparse facade is accented by carvings that resemble layers of lace. The doorway is flanked by two sets of elaborately decorated arched windows, with six windows on each side. Above the windows is a balustrade supporting statues of saints that project over stone bases from the frieze. The facade also features a triangular pediment with a statued arched niche.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/d1c6279a-f9a7-45ba-9c86-e77d7be1bf3c,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/8da9e0a6-5d8b-416c-afac-8d2484c4fc70,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/c93533bb-0439-48fa-ba70-92d15168039e,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/5845499d-c5f0-4cd3-b17d-1d63ff538096,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/2fa7c76f-83c6-4059-95bc-93001b025bcb}	{none}	Batangas	Tanauan	Poblacion I

Twenty eight years later, floods destroyed the church. In 1894, It was transferred to its present site. It was formally inaugurated in 1894 with Father Celestino Yoldi, OAR as its parish priest. A bell tower was appended to the building between 1928 and 1935. In 1978, due to lack of personnel, the Recolleto Fathers had to give up the administration of the parish. Thus, through an approved resolution of the Diocese of Lipa, the Oblates of St. Joseph took charge of the parish in exchange of the Parish of Cuenca. This was to entrust also the entire Fourth Vicariate of the diocese under the spiritual care of the Congregation. The OSJ fathers began their pastoral administration on May 1 of that year. Throughout the years the structure had needed much repairs. Thus, in 1995, during the term of Rev. Fr. Raymundo dela Cruz, OSJ, the church underwent major renovation. To preserve the architectural design, the facade and the bell tower were left as they were. But the interiors were replaced with a more durable structure.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/2a37d133-fabf-43e5-af14-90499b59f5a3,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/0446936a-e7a3-4eb4-966d-c80347842b74,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/6ac6edbc-842c-4f23-8cd7-a63a69ff1cb7,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/e67e0979-fa58-4645-8360-278cb06971c9,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/25e82cdc-5b14-4378-8c65-a179f6a7d782}	{none}	Batangas	San Juan	Poblacion

In fact, it was founded last February 2, 2017 and the story behind its fast completion is what makes this parish even more special. The majority of the constructions took place during the heights of the pandemic. Thanks to the donations from the locals and sponsors, the church is now almost complete and has become one of the in-demand wedding venues in Batangas. San Antonio de Padua Parish in Nasugbu welcomes visitors to a very serene atmosphere. It comes with a very spacious landscape that quickly reminds of the San Antonio de Padua Parish in Silang, Cavite.Central Azucarera Church (Brgy. Lumbangan, Nasugbu, Batangas)\nThe church is closely associated with the Central Azucarera Don Pedro, a sugar mill and refinery located in Nasugbu. The presence of the church is significant because it caters to the spiritual needs of the workers and residents in the area, who are often employed in the sugar industry. While specific details about the architectural style or historical background of the Central Azucarera Church might not be widely available, it serves as a center for religious activities and fosters a sense of community among its parishioners.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/0da70766-e6da-4087-a0df-4c377a34f249,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/b7bf0d19-7680-406b-9962-cc1fc3827621,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/1ba6a3c3-0ba7-4d99-b83a-0e5f00602cbc,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/db712aa1-64d5-4128-9418-3a3552a67225,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/26ba3d38-eece-4056-aff1-0a48f3e03805}	{none}	Batangas	Nasugbu	Kaylaway

Looc. Later, the town transferred to its present location. In 1852, a church was dedicated to the Nuestra Seňora Virgen de le Escalera and St. Francis Xavier. In 1896, after the people of Nasugbu rose against the Spanish colonial regime, Spanish troops locked up almost 500 men, women and children inside the church and then set the church on fire. Another simple, wooden parish church was built on its present site. Eventually, the town’s growing population necessitated the construction of the much larger, present church which was started in the early 1990’s. During the Centennial Celebration of the Archdiocese of Lipa, the church was declared as a Pilgrimage Church.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/0a1512a7-3ea5-4bf6-a25e-e83bfd2a960d,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/dc509a19-a0d4-4e16-ba9b-4031a13316f6,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/5c679dc9-05f3-4521-a8b0-02539ca186cc,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/f2d67df4-b20f-4ca9-922d-f50b1537bfaf,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/842dce78-ec9a-4f2c-8c28-298eebf88b6b}	{none}	Batangas	Nasugbu	Brgy. 2

The church was put under the title of the Immaculate Conception. The church was burned down by the fire that gutted the whole town in 1615. In 1686, Father Jose Rodriguez began laying the new foundation of a new church made of stone. The main nave was finished in the same year with the help of Father Manuel del Buensuceso and the townspeople. Fr. Jose de San Bartolome completed the transept made of reef stone on 1706, and it was blessed in 1721. The church was gutted by fire again after a lightning bolt in 1747 and was repaired in 1756 during the time of Don Ramon Orendain.	{http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/770ec197-4f56-411c-9ea6-bdc5832b56e1,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/6268ab82-8e51-43fc-9815-0322b5e36285,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/cd676594-4630-44fd-a233-b59b8531febe,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/c98897ac-4ec8-4a32-89c0-c7fee1238045,http://goexplorebatangas.com/api/public/images/a8875e46-d5ca-4168-acf9-d5bf8d1676a0}	{none}	Batangas	Batangas City	M.H.
